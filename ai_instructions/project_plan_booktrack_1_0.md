    * A details icon to open the book's Manage Book screen, where all of its data can be edited.
* Timer Screen UI: The timer screen will use icons for its main actions instead of text. The notes for the book will be displayed in an open, editable field at the bottom of this screen.
* Iconography: Buttons should use intuitive icons instead of text labels.
    * 'Active' (Main View): A house icon.
    * 'All Books': A library/bookshelf icon.

#### 5.2. Software Quality Attributes

* USABILITY-1: A user must be able to start a reading session for a book from the main library view in no more than two clicks.
* RELIABILITY-1: Reading session data must be saved transactionally. A failure during saving should not result in a partially saved or corrupt log entry.
* RELIABILITY-2: In the event of an unexpected application crash or shutdown, the currently running timer's elapsed time shall be saved so it can be recovered on the next app launch.

#### 5.3. Business Rules

* BR-1: A timer cannot be started for a book whose status is "Read" or "Abandoned".
* BR-2: A timer cannot be started if there is another active timer (active means either running or paused).
